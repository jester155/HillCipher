CS:  the  science  that  deals  with  the  theory  and  methods  of  processing  information  in 
digital computers, the design of computer hardware and software, and the 
applications of computers. 
IT: the development, implementation, and maintenance of 
computer hardware and software systems to organize and communicate information 
electronically. Abbreviation: IT 
Computers  are  man-made  tools  that  aid  us  in  solving  other  problems.  A  biologist  is 
trying to figure out how life works, physicists and  chemists are trying to figure out 
how  items  react  in  our  universe,  mathematicians  are  trying  to  figure  out  rules  for 
man-made systems.
Any  research  problem  that  may  improve  a  computer’s  capability  of  helping  solve  a 
problem or any research problem that sheds light  about a new way to do something with 
a computer is part of CS.
Most exciting research: Medical Applications (Expert Systems for Diagnosis, 
Remote surgery, nano-devices with computing power to deliver medicine, etc.), 
We need help trying to create a comprehensive EMR accessible to the right people only, 
Cars that can drive themselves – seems like the best way we know how to solve lots of 
problems is by throwing lots of computing power at them, instead of looking for 
elegant solutions. This doesn’t sound exciting, but it will be exciting when the 
results are achieved. (ie Watson)
CS students tend to find jobs where they program at least some. 
In the process, they are solving problems.
Challenges: It’s impossible to teach all the new languages/toys. 
Ultimately, we just need to teach our students how to think, so that they can pick up 
new things on their own. Our biggest challenge is getting them to buy into that.
Ethical: Lots, with security etc.
